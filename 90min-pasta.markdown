# 90 Minute Pasta

## Ingredients

Pasta (Penne)  
1 white onion  
1 zucchini (courgette)  
500 grams of strained tomatoes  
150 grams of minced meat  
Black pepper  
Chili flakes  
Vegetable bouillon cubes  
Sugar  


## Recipe

### Onion
- Chop 1 onion
- Put a little oil in a skillet and heat at 4
- Put onion in skillet for 30 minutes
- Wait for onion strips to glaze over; seem transparent. Stir every few minutes.
- If onion starts browning it is either time for the next step or the heat is up too high

### Zucchini
- Dice 1 zucchini
- When the onion is ready, add the zucchini and mix well
- Raise the heat up to 5
- Wait 20-25 minutes until zucchini bits look glazed or mushy. Stir every few minutes.

### Sauce and spices
- Add 500 grams of strained tomatoes
- Crush two vegetable bouillon cubes into the sauce
- Add about 40 twists of the black pepper mill.
- Add about half a teaspoon of chili flakes
- Add a teaspoon of sugar
- Stir well, then again every few minutes.
- Once bubbles start to appear, lower the heat to 4

### Pasta
- Boil water in a pan at 8
- Add a pinch of salt to the water
- Once boiling, add the pasta. About 120-160 grams per person.
- Once it boils again lower the heat to 6.
- Lift the lid occasionally so it doesn't overflow.
- 9 minutes is enough for "al dente". Add about a minute for a little softer.
- Drain the water from the pan once done.

### Minced Meat
- Start on the minced meat about the same time you start boiling the water.
- Add a small mount of butter into a skillet and put the heat at 5
- Add 150 grams of minced meat into the pan and "roll" the meat plenty throughout.
- Add a few twists of black pepper for flavor.
- After about 10-15 minutes it should be all done.

### Putting it all together
- If done right, all parts should be done right about the same time.
- Mix the pasta in the pan with the sauce. Stir well.
- You can choose to keep the minced meat separate and add on the plate per preference.
- Enjoy!
